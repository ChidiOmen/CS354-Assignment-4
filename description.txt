Yuanjie Li's Assignment 1 Description

Implemented Functionality:
Box room (4 walls, floor, ceiling): All walls are one-directional meshes
  using the Examples/Rockwall mesh provided by Ogre.  Code generating these
  walls were based off of the code to generate the floor in Tutorial 1 from
  the Ogre website.
Ball: Moving in a pseudo-random direction, the ball (using an Ogre's head as
  a mesh) bounces around the room.  The head is only visible in the +y axis
  direction because it is also a one-directional mesh.  This mesh was taken
  from the Ogre website.  This ball casts a shadow in the blue spotlight.
Spotlight: Blue spotlight shines on one edge of the room.  Code generating
  this spotlight was borrowed from the Ogre tutorial on their website.
Camera Controls: The user can move the camera with the mouse and WASD keys.
  This code was borrowed from the Ogre tutorial on their website.
